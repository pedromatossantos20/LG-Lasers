# Laguerre-Gaussian Beams Simulation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the simulation and analysis of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams in optics. LG beams are a solution to the paraxial Helmholtz equation and are characterized by their unique structure carrying orbital angular momentum which enables the twist of materials with these lasers. This simulation provides insights into various properties and behaviors of LG beams, including their amplitude, phase, and interaction with matter.

## Features

- Calculation of beam parameters such as wavelength (`lamda`), beam waist (`w0`), and Rayleigh length (`z0`).
- Functions to compute the amplitude and phase of LG beams in different scenarios.
- Simulation of Hermitian-Gaussian(used to create LG beams) and Laguerre-Gaussian beams.
- Analysis of the torque exerted by the beams and its variation with different parameters.
- Visualization tools for plotting the intensity profiles of the beams.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
